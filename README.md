# X-Carousel
Jonathan Fielding

## Introduction
When working on a project recently I noticed the lack of versatile jQuery carousels available with all the features I needed. Rather than build a one off carousel for the project in my own time X-Carousel was born as a easy to use carousel which uses simple markup but with professional results.
